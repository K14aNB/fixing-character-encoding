卷第七　音辭　雜藝　終制
音辭第十八
    夫九州之人，言語不同，生民已來，固常然矣。自《春秋》標齊言之
傳，〈離騷〉目楚詞之經，此蓋其較明之初也。後有揚雄著《方言》，其
言大備。然皆考名物之同異，不顯聲讀之是非也。逮鄭玄注六經，高誘解
《呂覽》、《淮南》，許慎造《說文》，劉熹製《釋名》，始有譬況假藉
以證音字耳。而古語與今殊別，其間輕重清濁，猶未可曉；加以內言外言
、急言徐言、讀若之類，益使人疑。孫叔言創《爾雅音義》，是漢末人獨
知反語。至於魏世，此事大行。高貴鄉公不解反語，以為  怪異。自茲厥
後，音韻鋒出，各有土風，遞相非笑，指馬之諭，未知孰是。共以帝王都
邑，參校方俗，考覈古今，為之折衷。搉而量之，獨金陵與洛下耳。
    南方水土和柔，其音清舉而切詣，失在浮淺，其辭多鄙俗。北方山川
深厚，其音沈濁而  鈍，得其質直，其辭多古語。然冠冕君子，南方為優
；閭裡小人，北方為愈。易服而與之談，南方士庶，數言可辯；隔垣而聽
其語，北方朝野，終日難分。而南染吳、越，北雜夷虜，皆有深弊，不可
具論。其謬失輕微者，則南人以錢為涎，以石為射，以賤為羨，以是為舐
；北人以庶為戍，以如為儒，以紫為姊，以洽為狎。如此之例，兩失甚多
。至鄴已來，唯見崔子約、崔瞻叔侄，李祖仁、李蔚兄弟，頗事言詞，少
為切正。李季節著《音韻決疑》，時有錯失；陽休之造《切韻》，殊為疏
野。吾家兒女，雖在孩稚，便漸督正之；一言訛替，以為己罪矣。云為品
物，未考書記者，不敢輒名，汝曹所知也。
    古今言語，時俗不同；著述之人，楚、夏各異。《蒼頡訓詁》，反稗
為甫賣，反娃為於乖；《戰國策》音刎為免，《穆天子傳》音諫為間；《
說文》音戛為棘，讀皿為猛；《字林》音看為口甘反，音伸為辛；《韻集
》以成、仍、宏、登合成兩韻，為、奇、益、石分作四章；李登《聲類》
以系音羿，劉昌宗《周官音》讀乘若承；此例甚廣，必須考校。前世反語
，又多不切，徐仙民《毛詩音》反驟為在遘，《左傳音》切椽為徒緣，不
可依信，亦為眾矣。今之學士，語亦不正；古獨何人，必應隨其偽僻乎？
《通俗文》曰：「入室求曰搜。」反為兄侯。然則兄當音所榮反。今北俗
通行此音，亦古語之不可用者。璵璠，魯人寶玉，當音余煩，江南皆音藩
屏之藩。岐山當音為奇，江南皆呼為神祇之只。江陵陷沒，此音被於關中
，不知二者何所承案。以吾淺學，未之前聞也。
    北人之音，多以舉、莒為矩；唯李季節云：「齊桓公與管仲於台上謀
伐莒，東郭牙望見桓公口開而不閉，故知所言者莒也。然則莒、矩必不同
呼。」此為知音矣。
    夫物體自有精麤，精麤謂之好惡；人心有所去取，去取謂之好惡。此
音見於葛洪、徐邈。而河北學士讀《尚書》雲好生惡殺。是為一論物體，
一就人情，殊不通矣。
    甫者，男子之美稱，古書多假借為父子；北人遂無一人呼為甫者，亦
所未喻。唯管仲、范增之號，須依字讀耳。
    案：諸字書，焉者鳥名，或云語詞，皆音於愆反。自葛洪《要用字苑
》分焉字音訓：若訓何訓安，當音於愆反，「於焉逍遙」，「於焉嘉客」
，「焉用佞」，「焉得仁」之類是也；若送句及助詞，當音矣愆反，「故
稱龍焉」，「故稱血焉」，「有民人焉」，「有社稷焉」，「托始焉爾」
，「晉、鄭焉依」之類是也。江南至今行此分別，昭然易曉；而河北混同
一音，雖依古讀，不可行於今也。
    邪者，未定之詞。《左傳》曰：「不知天之棄魯邪？抑魯君有罪於鬼
神邪？」《莊子》云：「天邪？地邪？」《漢書》云：「是邪？非邪？」
之類是也。而北人即呼為也，亦為誤矣。難者曰：「〈繫辭〉云：『乾坤
，《易》之門戶邪？』此又為未定辭乎？」答曰：「何為不爾！上先標問
，下方列德以折之耳。」
    江南學士讀《左傳》，口相傳述，自為凡例，軍自敗曰敗，打破人軍
曰敗。諸記傳未見補敗反，徐仙民讀《左傳》，唯一處有此音，又不言自
敗、敗人之別，此為穿鑿耳。
    古人云：「膏粱難整。」以其為驕奢自足，不能克勵也。吾見王侯外
戚，語多不正，亦由內染賤保傅，外無良師友故耳。梁世有一侯，嘗對元
帝飲謔，自陳「癡鈍」，乃成「颸段」，元帝答之云：「颸異涼風，段非
干木。」謂「郢州」為「永州」，元帝啟報簡文，簡文云：『庚辰吳入，
遂成司隸。」如此之類，舉口皆然。元帝手教諸子侍讀，以此為誡。
    河北切攻字為古琮，與工、公、功三字不同，殊為僻也。比世有人名
邏，自稱為纖；名琨，自稱為袞；名洸，自稱為汪；名  ，自稱為獡。非
唯音韻舛錯，亦使其兒孫避諱紛紜矣。
雜藝第十九
    真草書跡，微鬚留意。江南諺云：「尺牘書疏，千里面目也。」承晉
、宋餘俗，相與事之，故無頓狼狽者。吾幼承門業，加性愛重，所見法書
亦多，而翫習功夫頗至，遂不能佳者，良由無分故也。然而此藝不須過精
。夫巧者勞而智者憂，常為人所役使，更覺為累；韋仲將遺戒，深有以也
。
    王逸少風流才士，蕭散名人，舉世惟知其書，翻以能自蔽也。蕭子雲
每歎曰：「吾著《齊書》，勒成一典，文章弘義，自謂可觀；唯以筆跡得
名，亦異事也。」王褒地冑清華，才學優敏，後雖入關，亦被禮遇。猶以
書工，崎嶇碑碣之間，辛苦筆硯之役，嘗悔恨曰：「假使吾不知書，可不
至今日邪？」以此觀之，慎勿以書自命。雖然，廝猥之人，以能書拔擢者
多矣。故道不同，不相為謀也。
    梁氏秘閣散逸以來，吾見二王真草多矣，家中嘗得十卷；方知陶隱居
、阮交州、蕭祭酒諸書，莫不得羲之之體，故是書之淵源。蕭晚節所變，
乃右軍年少時法也。
    晉、宋以來，多能書者。故其時俗，遞相染尚，所有部帙，楷正可觀
，不無俗字，非為大損。至梁天監之間，斯風未變；大同之末，訛替滋生
。蕭子雲改易字體，邵陵王頗行偽字；朝野翕然，以為楷式，畫虎不成，
多所傷敗。至為一字，唯見數點，或妄斟酌，逐便轉移。爾後墳籍，略不
可看。北朝喪亂之餘，書跡鄙陋，加以專輒造字，猥拙甚於江南。乃以百
念為憂，言反為變，不用為罷，追來為歸，更生為蘇，先人為老，如此非
一，遍滿經傳。唯有姚元標工於楷隸，留心小學，後生師之者眾。洎於齊
末，秘書繕寫，賢於往日多矣。
    江南閭裡間有〈畫書賦〉，乃陶隱居弟子杜道士所為；其人未甚識字
，輕為軌則，托名貴師，世俗傳信，後生頗為所誤也。
    畫繪之工，亦為妙矣；自古名士，多或能之。吾家嘗有梁元帝手畫蟬
雀白團扇及馬圖，亦難及也。武烈太子偏能寫真，坐上賓客，隨宜點染，
即成數人，以問童孺，皆知姓名矣。蕭賁、劉孝先、劉靈，並文學已外，
復佳此法。翫閱古今，特可寶愛。若官未通顯，每被公私使令，亦為猥役
。吳縣顧士端出身湘東王國侍郎，後為鎮南府刑獄參軍，有子曰庭，西朝
中書捨人，父子並有琴書之藝，尤妙丹青，常被元帝所使，每懷羞恨。彭
城劉岳，橐之子也，仕為驃騎府管記、平氏縣令，才學快士，而畫絕倫。
後隨武陵王入蜀，下牢之敗，遂為陸護軍畫支江寺壁，與諸工巧雜處。向
使三賢都不曉畫，直運素業，豈見此恥乎？
    弧矢之利，以威天下，先王所以觀德擇賢，亦濟身之急務也。江南謂
世之常射，以為兵射，冠冕儒生，多不習此；別有博射，弱弓長箭，施於
准的，揖讓升降，以行禮焉。防禦寇難，了無所益。亂離之後，此術遂亡
。河北文士，率曉兵射，非直葛洪一箭，已解追兵，三九讌集，常縻榮賜
。雖然要輕禽，截狡獸，不願汝輩為之。
    卜筮者，聖人之業也；但近世無復佳師，多不能中。古者，卜以決疑
，今人生疑於卜；何者？守道信謀，欲行一事，卜得惡卦，反令
，此之謂乎！且十中六七，以為上手，粗知大意，又不委曲。凡射奇偶，
自然半收，何足賴也。世傳云：「解陰陽者，為鬼所嫉，坎壈貧窮，多不
稱泰。」吾觀近古以來，尤精妙者，唯京房、管輅、郭璞耳，皆無官位，
多或罹災，此言令人益信。儻值世網嚴密，強負此名，便有詿誤，亦禍源
也。及星文風氣，率不勞為之。吾嘗學《六壬式》，亦值世閒好匠，聚得
《龍首》、《金匱》、《玉軨變》、《玉歷》十許種書，討求無驗，尋亦
悔罷。凡陰陽之術，與天地俱生，亦吉兇德刑，不可不信；但去聖既遠，
世傳術書，皆出流俗，言辭鄙淺，驗少妄多。至如反支不行，竟以遇害；
歸忌寄宿，不免兇終：拘而多忌，亦無益也。
    算術亦是六藝要事；自古儒士論天道，定律歷者，皆學通之。然可以
兼明，不可以專業。江南此學殊少，唯范陽祖晅精之，位至南康太守。河
北多曉此術。
    醫方之事，取妙極難，不勸汝曹以自命也。微解藥性，小小和合，居
家得以救急，亦為勝事，皇甫謐、殷仲堪則其人也。
    《禮》曰：「君子無故不徹琴瑟。」古來名士，多所愛好。洎於梁初
，衣冠子孫，不知琴者，號有所闕；大同以末，斯風頓盡。然而此樂愔愔
雅緻，有深味哉！今世曲解，雖變於古，猶足以暢神情也。唯不可令有稱
譽，見役勳貴，處之下坐，以取殘杯冷炙之辱。戴安道猶遭之，況爾曹乎
！
    《家語》曰：「君子不博，為其兼行惡道故也。」《論語》云：「不
有博弈者乎？為之，猶賢乎已。」然則聖人不用博弈為教；但以學者不可
常精，有時疲倦，則儻為之，猶勝飽食昏睡，兀然端坐耳。至如吳太子以
為無益，命韋昭論之；王肅、葛洪、陶侃之徒，不許目觀手執，此並勤篤
之志也。能爾為佳。古為大博則六箸，小博則二  ，今無曉者。比世所行
，一  十二  （棋），數術淺短，不足可翫。圍  （棋）有手談、坐隱之
目，頗為雅戲；但令人耽憒，廢喪實多，不可常也。
    投壺之禮，近世愈精。古者，實以小豆，為其矢之躍也。今則唯欲其
驍，益多益喜，乃有倚竿、帶劍、狼壺、豹尾、龍首之名。其尤妙者，有
蓮花驍。汝南周  ，弘正之子，會稽賀徽，賀革之子，並能一箭四十餘驍
。賀又嘗為小障，置壺其外，隔障投之，無所失也。至鄴以來，亦見廣寧
、蘭陵諸王，有此校具，舉國遂無投得一驍者。彈棋亦近世雅戲，消愁釋
憒，時可為之。
終制第二十
    死者，人之常分，不可免也。吾年十九，值梁家喪亂，其間與白刃為
伍者，亦常數輩；幸承餘福，得至於今。古人云：「五十不為夭。」吾已
六十餘，故心坦然，不以殘年為念。先有風氣之疾，常疑奄然，聊書素懷
，以為汝誡。
    先君先夫人皆未還建鄴舊山，旅葬江陵東郭。承聖末，已啟求揚都，
欲營遷厝。蒙詔賜銀百兩，已於揚州小郊北地燒  （磚），便值本朝淪沒
，流離如此，數十年間，絕於還望。今雖混一，家道罄窮，何由辦此奉營
資費？且揚都污毀，無復孑遺，還被下濕，未為得計。自咎自責，貫心刻
髓。計吾兄弟，不當仕進；但以門衰，骨肉單弱，五服之內，傍無一人，
播越他鄉，無復資蔭；使汝等沈淪廝役，以為先世之恥；故靦冒人間，不
敢墜失。兼以北方政教嚴切，全無隱退者故也。
    今年老疾侵，儻然奄忽，豈求備禮乎？一日放臂，沐浴而已，不勞復
魄，殮以常衣。先夫人棄背之時，屬世荒饉，家塗空迫，兄弟幼弱，棺器
率薄，藏內無  （磚）。吾當松棺二寸，衣帽已外，一不得自隨，床上唯
施七星板；至如蠟弩牙、玉豚、錫人之屬，並須停省，糧甖明器，故不得
營，碑誌旒旐，彌在言外。載以鱉甲車，襯土而下，平地無墳；若懼拜掃
不知兆域，當築一堵低牆於左右前後，隨為私記耳。靈筵勿設枕几，朔望
祥禫，唯下白粥清水乾棗，不得有酒肉餅果之祭。親友來餟酹者，一皆拒
之。汝曹若違吾心，有加先妣，則陷父不孝，在汝安乎？其內典功德，隨
力所至，勿刳竭生資，使凍餒也。四時祭祀，周、孔所教，欲人勿死其親
，不忘孝道也。求諸內典，則無益焉。殺生為之，翻增罪累。若報罔極之
德，霜露之悲，有時齋供，及七月半盂蘭盆，望於汝也。
    孔子之葬親也，云：「古者，墓而不墳。丘東西南北之人也，不可以
弗識也。」於是封之崇四尺。然則君子應世行道，亦有不守墳墓之時，況
為事際所逼也！吾今羈旅，身若浮雲，竟未知何鄉是吾葬地；唯當氣絕便
埋之耳。汝曹宜以傳業揚名為務，不可顧戀朽壤，以取堙沒也。

Project Gutenberg eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we usually do not
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
We are now trying to release all our eBooks one year in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.
Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg eBooks is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.
Most people start at our Web sites at:
http://gutenberg.net or
http://promo.net/pg
These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).
Those of you who want to download any eBook before announcement
can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.
http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext03 or
ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext03
Or /etext02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90
Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
as it appears in our Newsletters.
Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):
