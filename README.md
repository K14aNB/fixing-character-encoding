# Character Encoding Examples

Character encodings are sets of mappings from raw bits (0’s and 1’s) to text characters.  
When a text encoded with a specific encoder is decoded with a different encoder, it changes the output text. Sometimes this results in completely unreadable text.  

## About the dataset:  
This dataset is made up of six text files that represent five different character encodings and six different languages. 
The character encodings represented in this dataset are ISO-8859-1 (also known as Latin 1), ASCII, Windows 1251, UTF-16 that has been successfully converted into the UTF-8 and BIG-5. 
More information on the files is available in the file_guide.csv file.
